# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

## Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! 🚀
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data warehousing and analytics solution, from raw data ingestion to generating actionable business insights. It showcases best practices in Data Engineering, Data Modeling, and Analytics—perfect for both learning and portfolio presentation.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The project follows the Medallion Architecture pattern — Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:

Bronze Layer: Contains raw, unprocessed data ingested from multiple sources (CSV files) into a SQL Server database.

Silver Layer: Cleansed, standardized, and validated data ready for integration and analysis.

Gold Layer: Curated, business-ready data modeled in a Star Schema for analytics and reporting.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a modern data warehouse and analytics system using SQL Server.

### Key Components:

Data Architecture – Designed using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold).

ETL Pipelines – Extract, Transform, and Load processes to move data through the layers.

Data Modeling – Creation of Fact and Dimension tables for analytical efficiency.

Analytics & Reporting – SQL-based reports and dashboards for decision-making insights.

### 🎯 Areas of Expertise Showcased:

SQL Development

Data Engineering

Data Modeling

ETL & Pipeline Development

Business Intelligence & Analytics

### 🛠️ Tools & Resources

Everything you need to build this project is free and accessible:

### Datasets
 – Raw CSV files used in this project.

### SQL Server Express
 – Lightweight SQL database engine.

### SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
 – GUI tool for database management.

### GitHub
 – For version control and code hosting.

### Draw.io

## 🚀 Project Requirements
### 🧱 Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

### Objective:
Develop a scalable data warehouse using SQL Server that consolidates and transforms sales data for analytical reporting.

### Specifications:

Data Sources: CSV files from ERP and CRM systems.

Data Quality: Clean, validate, and standardize the data.

Integration: Merge both datasets into a unified analytical model.

Scope: Latest dataset (no historical tracking required).

Documentation: Maintain clear data model and process documentation.

### 📊 Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

### Objective:
Use SQL-based analytics to uncover key insights in:

Customer behavior

Product performance

Sales trends

These insights empower decision-makers to act on data-driven findings.
